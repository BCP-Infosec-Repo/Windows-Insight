The content of this repository aims to assist efforts on analysing inner working principles, functionalities, and properties of the Microsoft Windows operating system. This repository stores relevant documentation as well as executable files needed for conducting analysis studies.

Some of the content of this repository has been created in the course of a project named 'Studie zu Systemaufbau, Protokollierung, Härtung und Sicherheitsfunktionen in Windows 10 (SiSyPHuS Win10)' (ger.) - 'Study of system design, logging,
hardening, and security functions in Windows 10' (eng.). This project has been contracted by the [German Federal Office for Information Security](https://www.bsi.bund.de/) (ger., Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik - BSI). The work planned as part of the project is conducted by [ERNW GmbH](https://www.ernw.de/), starting in May 2017.

This repository is structured as follows:

- Folder [files](/files): This folder stores executable files, such as scripts and library DLL files, needed for conducting an analysis study.

- Folder [articles](/articles): This folder stores documentation articles on internal functionalities and properties of the Windows operating system. This documentation is often associated to executable files stored in the ‘files’ folder. It is structured with respect to different technologies or components of the Windows operating system.  Documentation articles often take a reverse-engineer's view so that readers can recreate analysis work and observe on their own.
